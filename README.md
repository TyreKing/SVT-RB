Most comments are in the Code.

The First solution was rather quick and straight forward Using Linq to work my way through (kinda boring). 

So I attempted a different solution, this one took the majority of the time I set aside for this project. It gets the average minimum bot using recursion. Doing it this way, we can get rid of the bots that are too far away and with too little battery level compared to the average of the remaining bots. This could be useful if the bot needs to travel a bit further after picking up the payload to deliver it somewhere else.

I wanted to squeeze one more in, which I was going to do a simple bruteforce. This would also provied the best result, but at the cost of efficiency. I would do this by having a nested for loop, but I already spent too much time on the recursive method. Pretty entertaining problem to solve, thanks!
